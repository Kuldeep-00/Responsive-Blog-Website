        <p>Lions, often known as the "King of the Jungle," are majestic creatures found primarily in Africa. They have a
            complex social structure called a pride, where multiple females, their offspring, and one or more males live
            together. Lions are skilled hunters and have evolved to hunt in groups, often targeting large herbivores
            such as buffalo, zebras, and antelopes.</p>

        <h2>Social Structure of Lions</h2>
        <p>A lion pride is a tightly-knit family unit. Males typically dominate the pride, but they rely on the females
            for hunting and protection. Males defend the prideâ€™s territory, ensuring that no other lions encroach upon
            their space. The females are the primary hunters and raise the cubs, with the pride providing mutual support
            and care.</p>

        <h2>Hunting and Diet</h2>
        <p>Lions are apex predators, and their diet consists mostly of large herbivores. They often work together to
            bring down their prey, with the females doing most of the hunting. Lions are known for their stealth and
            coordination during a hunt, typically stalking their prey before making a sudden charge. Their strength and
            teamwork make them formidable hunters.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Despite their status as one of the most well-known animals in the world, lions face significant challenges in
            the wild. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching have led to a decline in lion populations.
            Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival for future
            generations.</p>
