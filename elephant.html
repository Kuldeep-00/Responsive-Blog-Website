            <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their intelligence and social structures. They
                are found in Asia and Africa, each with distinct characteristics. Elephants have a strong sense of
                community, and their ability to communicate with each other over long distances using infrasound is
                extraordinary. Their trunk is one of the most unique and functional features, allowing them to grab
                food, drink water, and even communicate with their young.</p>
            <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
            <p>Elephants live in a variety of habitats, from savannas to forests. They are herbivores, feeding on
                grasses, fruits, and tree bark. They need to consume large amounts of food daily, and their eating
                habits contribute to maintaining their ecosystems by preventing certain types of plants from becoming
                overgrown.</p>
            <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>Elephants are facing serious threats from poaching and habitat loss. Conservation organizations are
                working to protect these majestic creatures, ensuring their survival for future generations. Efforts
                include anti-poaching laws, community awareness, and the protection of elephant habitats.</p>
