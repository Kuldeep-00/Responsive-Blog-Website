        <p>Whales are magnificent marine mammals that can be found in oceans around the world. There are several species
            of whales, ranging from the giant blue whale to the agile orcas. These marine giants are not only important
            for the ocean's ecosystem but also have unique behaviors that have fascinated researchers for centuries.</p>

        <h2>Whale Migration Patterns</h2>
        <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of whale behavior is their long migratory patterns. Whales travel
            thousands of miles from feeding grounds in colder waters to breeding grounds in warmer waters. This
            migration is essential for their reproduction and survival, and researchers use satellite tagging to track
            their journey across oceans.</p>

        <h2>Whale Communication</h2>
        <p>Whales communicate with each other using complex sounds. These vocalizations can travel vast distances under
            water, and researchers have found that whales use different calls for various purposes, including
            navigation, mating, and social interaction. The songs of humpback whales, in particular, are famous for
            their complexity and length.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Whales face numerous threats, including hunting, pollution, and climate change. Despite a ban on commercial
            whaling, illegal whaling still poses a significant threat to whale populations. Conservation organizations
            are working tirelessly to protect whale habitats, promote sustainable practices, and raise awareness about
            the importance of these majestic creatures.</p>
