            <p>Sharks are some of the most fascinating creatures in the ocean. With their sleek bodies and sharp teeth,
                they have been evolving for more than 400 million years. Sharks play an essential role in maintaining
                the health of marine ecosystems by regulating the population of prey species and removing sick or weak
                individuals. There are over 500 species of sharks, ranging from the small dwarf lanternshark to the
                massive whale shark.</p>
            <h2>Ecological Role</h2>
            <p>Sharks are apex predators, sitting at the top of the food chain. Their diet mainly consists of smaller
                fish and marine mammals, but they help balance the population of these species. This balance is crucial
                for the health of the entire marine ecosystem. Sharks help keep prey populations in check, preventing
                overgrazing and maintaining biodiversity.</p>
            <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
            <p>Many species of sharks are currently at risk due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and the shark fin
                trade. Conservation efforts are being made to protect these important creatures, including the creation
                of marine protected areas and campaigns to reduce the demand for shark fins.</p>
